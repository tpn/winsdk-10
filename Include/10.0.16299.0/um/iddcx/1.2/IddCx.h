// DDI Version model
// -----------------
// The interface version model will be based on structure versions, when a DDI call/OS callback needs to be updated
// the version of that callback we be incremented along with any structures used, for example if v1 of a call was :
//
//     void SomeDDICall(IDDCX_ADAPTER hOsAdapterContext, IDARG_IN_SOME_DDI* pInArgs);
//
// and the functionality/params needed to be changed then the following would be added:
//
//     void SomeDDICall2(IDDCX_ADAPTER hOsAdapterContext, IDARG_IN_SOME_DDI2* pInArgs);
//
// and the DDI function table structure would be updated to IDDCX_DDI2 which would have SomeDDICall replaced with
// SomeDDICall2.  At the same time a new create interface v2 would be used by a driver

// IDDCX Version model
// -------------------
// In order for drivers to know precisely which version of IddCx the driver is running the driver can call the
// IddCxGetVersion() callback.  This helps if IddCx bug that effect behavior are fixed and released within a given OS release,
// for example if a IddCx bug was fixed in the Windows 10 Creators Update after release and the driver needed to know if the
// IddCx being used had that fix they could use IddCxGetVersion()

#define IDDCX_VERSION_RS3 0x1200
#define IDDCX_VERSION_LATEST IDDCX_VERSION_RS3


// Timeout detection and recovery
// ------------------------------
// The OS will monitor the drivers processing of frames and if it detects the driver is not making forward progress it will
// take action to ensure the desktop is not effected.
// The OS will monitor the driver in two ways :
//
// 1) Ensure that each OS->driver call does not take longer than 10 seconds
// 2) Ensure that a driver reports that it has finished process a given frame within 10 seconds, that is that the driver does
//    not call FinishedProcessingFrame() within 10 seconds of the new frame ready event is triggered
//
// In the event of a timeout being detected then the OS will call the UMDF BugCheck() call which will cause the UMDF host
// process to terminate and restart subject to UMDF device restart policy.
